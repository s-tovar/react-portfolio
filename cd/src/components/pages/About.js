        <p>
          Hello! I'm Steven Tovar, a first-generation college graduate with a
          background in education. For years, I found immense joy in
          facilitating learning and empowering young minds. However, my lifelong
          passion for technology and problem-solving led me down an exciting new
          pathâ€”Web Development. I decided to take the plunge and enrolled in the
          Fullstack Flex Coding Bootcamp at UCR. The program's
          rigorous curriculum and hands-on approach have provided me with the
          skill set to transition smoothly into the tech industry. While I
          enjoyed every facet of the bootcamp, I found that my strengths truly
          shined in backend logic. The challenge of constructing efficient
          algorithms and databases energizes me, and I thrive in solving complex
          problems that fuel the functionality of a web application. I'm excited
          about this new journey and am open to opportunities where I can apply
          my newly-acquired skills to real-world problems. I believe in the
          transformative power of technology and am eager to contribute to
          projects that make a difference. Feel free to reach out at
